# Super Particle Theorem

![3D free body diagram](../3D%20free%20body%20diagram.jpg)
Newton's law: $d\bm{F} = \bm{\ddot{R}} dm$

Force's vector: $d\bm{F} = \bm{F_E} + \bm{F_I}$

Total force acting on system: $\bm{F} = \int_B d\bm{F} = \int_B d\bm{F_E}$

Center of Mass: $M\bm{R_c}= \int_B \bm{R}dm$

$$M\bm{\ddot{R}_c} = \int_B \bm{\ddot{R}}dm = \int_B d\bm{F}$$

Then:
$$M\bm{\ddot{R}} = \bm{F}$$

> $\bm{F_e}$ and $\bm{F_I}$ are external and internal forces respectively
